Well, I don't know, it's **probably difficult** to start, things like why do I do this, how do I do this, what is the purpose of this, etc...

I've been in the industry for like, **one and a half years** or something around that mark.

Knowing the **real life problems of software development, meetings with the client, resolving problems and implementing new features**.
Those things definitely give my brain a legit good amount of workout. And yeah, now that I wish I won't get bored way too quickly doing this thing ROFL.

Exicted for what's ahead, great to reflect on what I've been able to achieve and new friendships being built everywhere ^^.
